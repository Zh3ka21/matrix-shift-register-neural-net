# MSR Neural network

## Features

1. **Matrix Orders**: Display values of matrix orders F, A, and B - L.
2. **Polynomial Coefficients**: Input or view coefficients of selected polynomials f<sub>F</sub>(x), f<sub>A</sub>(x), and f<sub>B</sub>(x).
3. **Structural Matrices**: View structural matrices F, A, and B along with theoretical and experimental periods (T<sub>f</sub>, T<sub>a</sub>, T<sub>b</sub>).
4. **Matrix Inverses**: Calculate and display inverses of matrices F, A, and B (F⁻¹, A⁻¹, B⁻¹).
5. **Initial State Analysis**: Determine rank of matrix of initial states of MSR and view initial states in Smith normal form.
6. **PVP Sequence Generation**: Identify element (cell) of matrix (i, j) from which PVP sequence will be obtained for each rank of matrix of MSR state.
7. **Generator State Analysis**: Explore states of generators within MSR system.
8. **Hamming Weight Spectrum**: Analyze spectrum of Hamming weights, experimentally and analytically.
9. **Cyclic ACF Graphs**: Generate and visualize cyclic Autocorrelation Function (ACF) graphs.
10. **Control Tools**: Utilize tools for controlling operation of application, such as "Step by Step Iteration" or "Automatic Mode".
